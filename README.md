A Student-Facing, Interactive Network (SIN) Tool 
This demo designed a social learning analytics tool, namely a student-facing, interactive network (SIN) tool, 
to demonstrate three types of interactive networks of online dicussions. The three network representations 
were the student-student network, the student-term network, and the term-term network. This tool aimed to help 
students become aware of their interactions with peers, use of terms, and topic map in discussions, in order to 
improve student engagement in online discussions.
